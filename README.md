# utilizing_restarea_logistics
Won the excellence prize in the 2023 Data Sage Zone Utilization Joint Contest

## Overview
This project utilizes rest area shelter parking sensor data to propose optimal selection criteria for shelters that can provide logistics services without impairing their primary functions.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and basic statistical analysis
- Machine learning model model training and comparison : Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Time series analysis and forecasting " Auto ARIMA model for forecasting parking availability

## Implementation
- 'analysis.R' : Analysis changes in parking availability by year and hour through statistical tests and visualizations, and compares machine learning model
- 'arima.R' : Converts parking availability data into a time series format, applies ARIMA-based forecasting, and visualized evaluation metrics
**Note** : Due to the system's limitations, raw data from designated safe zones cannot be disclosed.
  The uploaded scripts contain only the code used for analysis during the competition.
